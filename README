About
-----
This program is a contribution to the community of greek UNIX users. It makes
it possible to change keyboard mapping with alt-shift or meta-shift 
combinations or by clicking on the flag image.  You will be able to write
greek in X programs like netscape or xedit. You must have the greek fonts,
which are not provided with this package.

New versions of the software can be found at:
http://www.softlab.ece.ntua.gr/~sivann/xgrk


Compatibility
-------------
Keycodes are auto-loaded on startup so it should work with all unices and
keyboard layouts.

This program has been tested with:

-Linux (2.2.5) (XFree)
-FreeBSD 
-Sun Ultra1 with Solaris 2.7 with the default sun's X11R6 and 24bit display 
-Silicon Graphics Indy R5500 with IRIX 6.2 the default X server and 8bit display

Requirements
------------
The XPM library (libXpm) which can be downloaded from:

ftp://koala.inria.fr/pub/xpm/


Installation
------------
1. run make
2. copy the xgrk binary somewhere like /usr/local/X11/bin

Usage
-----
You don't have to be root to run this software.
For the following information,  left or right keys are the same. Note that 
none of the keys has to be pressed at the same time, only the right order 
matters.

Keyboard switching:          Alt + Shift 
Accent:                      ';' and then the  letter
diaeresis (dialitika):       Shift + ';' and then the letter
accented diaeresis:          ';' then Shift+';' and then the letter 

Characters ';' and ':' are mapped to the 'q' key in greek mode.

You may also switch language by clicking onto the flag.

Notes for greek support in Netscape
-----------------------------------

Trick for netscape to display correctly greek fonts in forms & buttons: 

1. Start netscape with :
   netscape -xrm "*documentFonts.charset*iso8859-7:iso-8859-1"

2. Go to Edit->Preferences-Fonts, choose 8859-1 (netscape thinks that greek 
   fonts are 8859-1 now), and choose a greek font like Lucidasansgreek for
   the Variable Width Font field.
   Do the same for the Fixed Width font.

You're set. You can now use pages like http://www.hellasyellow.gr/onom.html
and write greek in the forms.


Notes for fvwm2
---------------
Add theese to the appropriate fields in your .fvwm2rc:

fvwm2 style:
Style   "xgrk"   RandomPlacement ,NoTitle, StaysOnTop, NoHandles, BorderWidth 0

fvwm2 swallow option.Very cool, it gets swallowed as a button in the bar:
*FvwmButtons( Center Size 60 40 Swallow(UseOld) xgrk `Exec exec xgrk &`)
